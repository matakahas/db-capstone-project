# Database Engineer Capstone
This repository contains files for the capstone project for the [database engineering course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/database-engineer-capstone/) offered by Meta. Through this class, I learned the following:

## Data modeling

* Designing a data model and drawing a diagram (Entity Relationship or ER Diagram) to describe relationships between datasets and attributes of each dataset
* Rendering the data model as a database with the forward engineering feature
* Tool(s) used: MySQL Workbench

## Database queries

* Writing various SQL statements to summarize, manage, and analyze data
* Optimizing queries by means of stored procedures and prepared statements
* Writing queries to perform CRUD operations with an option to revert changes
* Scripts: `view_join.sql`, `procedures_statements.sql`, `bookings.sql`, `bookings2.sql`

## Data visualization
* Working with a large dataset and performing data analytics and visualization with Tableau
* Relevant files: `little-lemon-dm.mwb`
